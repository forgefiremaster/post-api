[Info  - 6:47:25 PM] ESLint server is running.
[Info  - 6:47:26 PM] 
Failed to load the ESLint library for the document /home/lucas/Documents/desenvolvimento/react-native/ListaDePostsRedux/src/actions/post/posts_action.js

To use ESLint please install eslint by running 'npm install eslint' in the workspace folder ListaDePostsRedux
or globally using 'npm install -g eslint'. You need to reopen the workspace after installing eslint.

If you are using yarn instead of npm set the setting `"eslint.packageManager": "yarn"`

Alternatively you can disable ESLint for the workspace folder ListaDePostsRedux by executing the 'Disable ESLint' command.
