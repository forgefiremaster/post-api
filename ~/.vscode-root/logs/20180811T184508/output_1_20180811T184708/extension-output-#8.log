Failed to load the TSLint library for the document /home/lucas/Documents/desenvolvimento/react-native/ListaDePostsRedux/src/actions/post/posts_action.js

To use TSLint in this workspace please install tslint using 'npm install tslint' or globally using 'npm install -g tslint'.
TSLint has a peer dependency on `typescript`, make sure that `typescript` is installed as well.
You need to reopen the workspace after installing tslint.
